# Hi, I'm Torben 👋

I'm a programmer from Berlin, Germany with 17+ years experience in the industry.

Currently primarily doing consulting, architecture and migration strategies.

- 👔 Tech Lead/CTO and co-founder of [@StackmeisterGmbH](https://github.com/StackmeisterGmbH) (https://stackmeister.com)
- 🏈 Owner of [@Talesoft](https://github.com/Talesoft), my own company from many years ago
- ✨ Many old and fun projects on this user here, some older than 10 years. Like a museum of my skill-level!
- ✌️ I'm **not** looking for jobs (I'm really happy with mine)
- 👀 I am looking for german-speaking engineers, however! Full-stack devs and devops, if you'd like to work with me, feel free to contact <info@stackmeister.com>
